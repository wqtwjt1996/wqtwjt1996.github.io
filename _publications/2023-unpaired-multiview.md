short_title: Unpaired Multiview Alignment
abstract: "We are concerned with a challenging scenario in unpaired multiview video learning. In this case, the model can learn comprehensive multiview representations while the cross-view semantic information is not exactly the same. We propose a method named Semantics-based Unpaired Multiview Learning to tackle this unpaired multiview learning problem. The key idea is to build cross-view pseudo-pairs and do view-invariant alignment by leveraging semantic information of videos. To facilitate the data efficiency of multiview learning, we further employ video-text alignment for all first-person and third-person videos, to fully make the semantic knowledge improve video representation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets prove the effectiveness of our framework. Our method also outperforms multiple existing view-alignment methods, under the more challenging scenario than typical paired or unpaired multimodal or multiview learning."
